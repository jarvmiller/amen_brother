This repository contains the code and data used to create one of my blog posts titled "Amen, Brother". You can see the posts and more at jarvmiller.github.io.

Here is a quick tour of the code

- scrape_sample_songs.ipynb
    - Mostly uses `urllib.request` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the title, artist, year of creation, and sampled instrument from each song that sampled "Amen, Brother".
    - Follow this link to see the site. https://www.whosampled.com/The-Winstons/Amen,-Brother/sampled/

- spotify_data.ipynb
    - Mostly uses `requests_oauthlib` and `requests` to search for audio data for each scraped song. Each request was made to Spotify's Web API. Look at this  notebook for a way to create oAuth2 sessions. 
    - Sadly, less than 40% of the songs were retrieved. This might be due to the true/desired song not being within the first 20 results or bc of issues matching the Artist due to naming issues (e.g Beyonc√® vs Beyonce or Diddy vs P.Diddy vs Puff Daddy)

- songs_viz.R
    - Uses ggplot2 to create all the visualizations. This was the most fun part :) I miss R a lot and finally took the time to explore manual colors instead of using the default palette ggplot2 uses.
